Conference paper acceptance: "Mapping News Geography: A Computational Framework for Classifying Local Media Through Geographic Coverage Patterns" generates a data-driven typology of subnational news outlets in the UK, using the spatial properties of their coverage. I will present this work in December at the Computational Humanities Research conference in Luxembourg.
