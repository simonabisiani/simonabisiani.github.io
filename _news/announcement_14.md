Conference paper acceptance: <a href="https://osf.io/preprints/mediarxiv/km2a7_v1">"Mapping News Geography: A Computational Framework for Classifying Local Media Through Geographic Coverage Patterns"</a> generates a data-driven typology of subnational news outlets in the UK, using the spatial properties of their coverage. I will present this work in December at the Computational Humanities Research conference in Luxembourg.
