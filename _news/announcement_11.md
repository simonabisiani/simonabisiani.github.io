I am presenting <a href="https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/zsxdg_v1">a paper</a> on work carried out for the <a href="https://www.publicinterestnews.org.uk/">Public Interest News Foundation</a>, financed by the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-culture-media-and-sport">Department for Culture, Media and Sport</a> on how to automate the tracking of existing local media outlets in the UK at <a href="https://dh2025.adho.org/">DH Conf</a> in Lisbon, Portugal.
