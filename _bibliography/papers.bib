	abstract={In this paper, we present UKTwitNewsCor, a comprehensive dataset for understanding the content production, dissemination, and audience engagement dynamics of online local media in the UK. It comprises over 2.5 million online news articles published between January 2020 and December 2022 from 360 local outlets. The corpus represents all articles shared on Twitter by the social media accounts of these outlets. We augment the dataset by incorporating social media performance metrics for the articles at the tweet level. We further augment the dataset by creating metadata about content duplication across domains. Alongside the article dataset, we supply three additional datasets: a directory of local media web domains, one of UK Local Authority Districts, and one of digital local media providers, providing statistics on the coverage scope of UKTwitNewsCor. Our contributions enable comprehensive, longitudinal analysis of UK local media, news trends, and content diversity across multiple platforms and geographic areas. In this paper, we describe the data collection methodology, assess the dataset geographic and media ownership diversity, and outline how researchers, policymakers, and industry stakeholders can leverage UKTwitNewsCor to advance the study of local media.},

 abstract={The UK local news landscape faces significant challenges, with declines in outlets, staffing, and relevance due to market pressures, digital disruption, and media consolidation. This crisis is compounded by the lack of a comprehensive, up-to-date directory of local news outlets, hindering research and policy interventions. Existing directories are often incomplete, outdated, and fail to capture the diversity of the local media landscape. To address this, the Public Interest News Foundation (PINF) has developed a semi-automated system leveraging open-source intelligence (OSINT) and computational workflows to maintain a comprehensive and current directory of local news outlets across print, digital, radio, and television in the UK. This system tracks closures, launches, ownership changes, and geographic coverage. Notable events are flagged for manual review. This research and review pipeline, combining computational analysis with human review, significantly reduces manual labor while enhancing data accuracy. Overall, the system offers a model for future initiatives aimed at tracking the health of local news ecosystems. The implications of this system for media pluralism, policy interventions, and the sustainability of local journalism are discussed, alongside suggestions for future research.},

	abstract = {Local journalism is fundamental for a thriving democracy, yet the {UK} faces a decline in the number of print and digital local news outlets. Large-scale mappings of the surviving outlets offer invaluable insights to policymakers designing interventions to strengthen the sector. Due to the lack of a comprehensive national directory of {UK} print and digital local news outlets, researchers have resorted to datasets such as circulation auditors’ databases, which have been additional_infod to be incomplete and outdated. A lack of understanding of the magnitude of these data limitations hinders researchers from selecting optimal datasets. This study evaluates four commonly used local news databases, uncovering significant variations in their currentness and comprehensiveness. Thereafter, statistical analyses demonstrate the significant effect of each dataset’s shortcomings on findings in local news research. To address this issue, triangulation and manual verification are employed to create a more comprehensive and robust dataset. This procedure generates a new national dataset of print and digital local news outlets that can be used in future research, alongside a framework for leveraging public data to build an independent research dataset. This work paves the way for more rigorous research in data-driven local news provision studies. Concluding remarks stress the importance of setting definitions and establishing clear data pipelines in an increasingly diversified and dynamic sector.},

	abstract = {In the last decade, data journalism has established itself as a thriving field. Recently, {COVID}-19 has boosted the demand for data-driven reporting to make sense of the pandemic, increasing the importance of studying the evolution of this rapidly evolving and technology-bounded practice. However, the number of efforts to map and systematically measure the data journalism industry are few. This paper analyses the findings of The State of the Data Journalism Survey 2021, currently the most extensive study on the characteristics surrounding the workforce producing and contributing to the data journalism industry. The outcome is an understanding of an expanding workforce with a geographically uneven distribution, which is still homogeneous in terms of tools and educational paths. Self-taught, resourceful, and multi-skilled, data journalists often work in isolation but share pressures of limited resources, time limitations, and access to quality data. The pandemic appears to have directly increased those struggles, although data journalists agree that the field’s reputation has ultimately benefited from it.},
