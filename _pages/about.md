I am a <b>computational journalism Doctoral Researcher</b> at the newly founded <b>Surrey Institute for People-Centred AI</b>. My PhD focuses on measuring <b>spatial variations in news coverage in the UK</b> to understand the robustness of local media coverage across the country, and how ownership consolidation affects media diversity and relevance - and whether media diversity and relevance affect democratic engagement. My primary research methods are <b>text mining (including ML), and causal inference</b>.

I have worked as a Data Architect at the Public Interest News Foundation (PINF), designing and maintaining their local news outlets database, as well as researching the data and <a href="https://www.publicinterestnews.org.uk/local-news-map-report-2024">writing about this</a>.

I have also worked as a <b>data journalist</b> at <a href="www.sheldon.studio">Sheldon.studio</a> and at <a href="www.datajournalism.com">DataJournalism.com</a>. At DataJournalism.com, I have created, analysed, visualised, and digitally presented <b>the State of Data Journalism 2021, 2022, and 2023</b> surveys. At Sheldon.studio, I was the principal data analyst, chart chooser, and content writer for <a href="https://disableddata.fightthestroke.org/">Disabled Data</a>, a project that shed light on the difficulties surrounding availability of data on people with disabilities in Italy, and on <a href = "https://data.europa.eu/apps/eusanctionstracker/">The Sanction Tracker</a> for <a href="https://data.europa.eu/en">data.europa.eu</a>.
