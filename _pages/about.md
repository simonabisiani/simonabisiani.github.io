I am a <strong>computational journalism Doctoral Researcher</strong> at the <a href="#">Surrey Institute for People-Centred AI</a>. My research combines <strong>advanced text mining, machine learning, and causal inference</strong> to map spatial variations in news coverage and measure the impact of ownership patterns on media diversity.
    
As <strong>data architect</strong> at the <a href="https://www.publicinterestnews.org.uk">Public Interest News Foundation</a>, I designed and maintain the UK's most comprehensive local news outlets database while producing  <a href="https://www.publicinterestnews.org.uk/local-news-map-report-2024">industry-leading research reports</a> commissioned by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport to inform policy discussions about media sustainability and democratic access to information.
    
I have <strong>authored multiple peer-reviewed publications</strong> and <strong>led the annual State of Data Journalism Survey</strong> for the European Journalism Centreâ€”the field's most comprehensive global industry analysis. My research has been featured at top-tier conferences including ICWSM, the International Journalism Festival, and Computation + Journalism.
    
Previously, I worked as a <strong>data journalist</strong> at <a href="https://www.sheldon.studio">Sheldon.studio</a> and <a href="https://www.ejc.net">the European Journalism Centre</a>, where I created award-worthy projects including <a href="https://disableddata.fightthestroke.org/">Disabled Data</a> (highlighting data accessibility issues in Italy) and <a href = "https://data.europa.eu/apps/eusanctionstracker/">The Sanction Tracker</a> for the European Data Portal. 

I specialise in <strong>R, Python, NLP, and computational social science methods</strong> that reveal hidden patterns in media landscapes.
